               modeling are accurate but too slow and inflexible for modern
               applications such as optimization or scenario analysis. Reduced
               complexity surrogate modeling has been applied in response to
               this, however, current approaches are expensive to set up and
               still require high‐fidelity simulations to derive parameters. In
               this study, we compare and develop graph partitioning algorithms
               to automatically group sections of sewer networks into
               semi‐distributed compartments. These compartments can then be
               simulated using sewer network information only in the integrated
               modeling framework, CityWat‐SemiDistributed (CWSD), which has
               been developed for application to sewer network modeling in this
               study. We find that combining graph partitioning with CWSD can
               produce accurate simulations 100--1,000$\times$ faster than
               existing high‐fidelity modeling. Because we anticipate that many
               CWSD users will not have high‐fidelity models available, we
               demonstrate that the approach provides reasonable simulations
               even under significant parametric uncertainty through a
               sensitivity analysis. We compare multiple graph partitioning
               techniques enabling users to specify the spatial aggregation of
               the partitioned network, also enabling them to preserve key
               locations for simulation. We test the impact of temporal
               resolution, finding that accurate simulations can be produced
               with timesteps up to one hour. Our experiments show a log‐log
               relationship between temporal/spatial resolution and simulation
               time, enabling users to pre‐specify the efficiency and accuracy
               needed for their applications. We expect that the efficiency and
               flexibility of our approach may facilitate novel applications of
               sewer network models ranging from continuous simulations for
               long‐term planning to spatially optimizing the placement of

               acknowledgement that transitions in the water system are driven
               by changes in the urban environment, as well as societal
               dynamics. Inherent to the complexity of these underlying
               processes is that the dynamics of a system's evolution cannot be
               explained by linear cause-effect relationships and cannot be
               predicted under narrow sets of assumptions. Planning therefore
               needs to consider the functional behaviour and performance of
               integrated flexible infrastructure systems under a wide range of
               future conditions. This paper presents the first step towards a
               new generation of integrated planning tools that take such an
               exploratory planning approach. The spatially explicit model,
               denoted DAnCE4Water, integrates urban development patterns,

  abstract  = "Abstract. Belowground urban stormwater networks (BUSNs) are
               critical for removing excess rainfall from impervious urban
               areas and preventing or mitigating urban flooding. However,
               available BUSN data are sparse, preventing the modeling and
               analysis of urban hydrologic processes at regional and larger
               scales. We propose a novel algorithm for estimating BUSNs by
               drawing on concepts from graph theory and existing, extensively
               available land surface data, such as street network, topography,
               and land use/land cover. First, we derive the causal
               relationships between the topology of BUSNs and urban surface
               features based on graph theory concepts. We then apply the
               causal relationships and estimate BUSNs using web-service data
               retrieval, spatial analysis, and high-performance computing
               techniques. Finally, we validate the derived BUSNs in the
               metropolitan areas of Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston, and
               Baltimore in the US, where real BUSN data are partly available
               to the public. Results show that our algorithm can effectively
               capture 59 \%--76 \% of the topology of real BUSN data,
               depending on the supporting data quality. This algorithm has

              simulations are achievable with a synthetic approach even for

               Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) \#6. Currently, it is
               estimated that this goal cannot be met by 2030. Despite all
               kinds of administrational hurdles, meeting SDG\#6 depends on
               considerable investment. In order to get a chance at fulfilling
               SGD\#6, the most cost-effective wastewater management has to be
               identified. Wastewater can be managed in different ways ranging
               from central treatment plants connected to individual households
               through sewer networks down to tanker fleets servicing each
               household. Depending on the geographical setting, investment
               costs, operation and maintenance as well as social acceptance
               there is no single best solution. Instead, identifying the
               optimal wastewater management is highly localized and
               country-specific or even settlement-specific. Within this study
               we present a data-reduced scenario generation and assessment for
               wastewater management based on the ALLOWS method that can be
               applied to individual settlements. Results provide cost-ranked
               wastewater management scenarios that enable decision makers to
               select the most cost-effective and feasible scenario. Our study
               starts with a detailed step-by-step methodology of a
               data-reduced ALLOWS approach. The approach is applied to two
               small settlements in Jordan and Oman with comparable population
               size for which a set of five scenarios along a decentralization
               gradient is defined and generated: centralized,
               semi-centralized, decentralized, and on-site/tanker. Considering
               spatial specificities and country-specific cost data, the five
               scenarios are cost-ranked and discussed in view of the two
               settlement settings. For Jordan specific treatment costs range
               from 3.8 to 6.9 USD/m3of treated water and for Oman from 2.3 to
               10.1 USD/m3. Although the scenario ranking differs, for both
               settlements the decentralized scenario is identified as the most
               cost effective, where wastewater is treated on-site for
               less-populated parts and by small cluster treatment plants for
               higher density parts. Further, potential extensions providing
               users with more functionality depending upon data availability
               for the data-reduced ALLOWS method are discussed. Using globally
               available data, the data-reduced can be applied worldwide. In
               view of SDG\#6, we present a methodology that closes the gap
               between country-scale investment estimates and the most
               cost-effective wastewater management scenarios at settlement
