# Summary

Urban drainage network models (UDMs) are useful for a variety of purposes, most notably simulating and alleviating pluvial flooding. Despite the clear usefulness of UDMs, they are often not used owing to the difficulty and expense of creating them. This creates a significant gap for users attempting to generate UDMs if they are not able to perform an expensive underground survey. A variety of literature exists to derive such UDMs from GIS data [@Chahinian2019-lg;@Reyes-Silva2022-pr]. We identify some key limitations of these approaches, most notably the lack of automatic data acquisition and preprocessing, that all approaches are closed-source to date, and that a key feature of such an approach should be to facilitate extension and customisation.

# Statement of need

Existing methods for synthesizing urban drainage networks have advanced significantly, producing hydraulically feasible models that closely approximate real-world systems [@Blumensaat2012-hd;@Reyes-Silva2022-pr]. However, these methods face three critical limitations. First, all are closed-source, restricting accessibility and limiting transparency for users and researchers. Second, they typically require users to source, preprocess, and input geospatial data manually, which creates a high technical barrier, especially in regions where data acquisition is challenging. Third, while the output of these methods is often sensitive to input parameters, they offer limited control over the generation process, making it difficult to adjust and refine models according to specific needs. The combination of complexity and lack of control in a UDM synthesis approach can lead to significant uncertainty in outputs, which remains difficult to manage.

SWMManywhere addresses these limitations by offering an open-source, globally applicable tool that automates data acquisition and preprocessing while providing users with a flexible, customizable workflow. Its parameterized design allows for detailed sensitivity analysis [@Dobson2024-dv], enabling users to better understand and manage uncertainties in urban drainage network synthesis. Unlike existing methods, SWMManywhere emphasizes user control, allowing for fine-tuning of outputs to meet specific project requirements. By integrating publicly available geospatial data, the tool minimizes the technical burden and ensures applicability in data-scarce regions, making it an ideal solution for both researchers and practitioners in urban water management.

## Outlook

While we believe that SWMManywhere is a useful tool it has a variety of current limitations that present an exciting outlook for future research. A variety of improvements to the overall realism of the approach may be made in the future.

- Foremost, based on the findings of a sensitivity analysis [@Dobson2024-dv], better identification of manhole locations and outfalls will be critical to narrowing uncertainty in simulation outputs and improving realism.
- Implementation of local design regulations is common practice in UDM synthesis [@Chegini2022-oo], but not implemented in SWMManywhere owing to its global scope. Users may customise design parameters, but implementing a global database of design parameters tailored to different regions may also be possible.
- Capturing the gradual evolution of a network over time is known to be important in UDM synthesis [@Rauch2017-jz], and further illustrated by SWMManywhere results [@Dobson2024-dv]. We do not know of a global database that provides the information that would be necessary to capture this, but it may exist in the future or for local applications.
- Hydraulic structures often dominate the behaviour of a drainage network [@Dobson2022-wq;@Thrysoe2019-pi], but are not accounted for by SWMManywhere. We envisage that a machine learning approach may be able to improve identification of structures such as weirs, while elements such as pumps have been incorporated into network synthesis for sanitary networks [@Khurelbaatar2021-sp].
