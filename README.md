SWMManywhere is a tool to synthesise and run urban drainage networks with the SWMM
software anywhere in the world.

## Features

- **Automatic data retrieval and preprocessing**: all of our data requirements
are met with global datasets, so all you need is a bounding box!
- **Customisable network synthesis**: change a range of parameters to create
different networks, power users can easily extend existing functionality.
- **Streamlined evaluation to compare with real networks**: we include a variety
of performance metrics and automatic running/comparing if you have your own SWMM model.
- **Command line interface**: All of this and more can be accessed by passing a
configuration file to a CLI.

## Installation

Install SWMManywhere:

```bash
pip install swmmanywhere
